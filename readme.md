<h4>API Endpoints</h4>


/api/v1/book for all book

/api/v1/book/1 for single book

/api/v1/book/create to create a book. POST request. post data: title, author, isbn

/api/v1/book/1/update to update a book. Post request same as create

/api/v1/book/1/delete to delete a book. Post request same as create


That's a basic RESTfull API example. I will try to add OAuth 2.0 authentication very soon. :)
